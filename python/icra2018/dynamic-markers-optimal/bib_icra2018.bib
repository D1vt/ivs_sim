abstract = {The displacement of a calibrated camera between two images of a planar object can be estimated by decomposing a homography matrix. The aim of this document is to propose a newmethod for solving the homography decomposition problem. This newmethod provides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditional numerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix and object-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homography matrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understanding on the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relations among the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws can be designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two final solutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no a priori knowledge for discerning among them.},

@article{Schweighofer2006,
abstract = {In theory, the pose of a calibrated camera can be uniquely determined from a minimum of four coplanar but noncollinear points. In practice, there are many applications of camera pose tracking from planar targets and there is also a number of recent pose estimation algorithms which perform this task in real-time, but all of these algorithms suffer from pose ambiguities. This paper investigates the pose ambiguity for planar targets viewed by a perspective camera. We show that pose ambiguities--two distinct local minima of the according error function--exist even for cases with wide angle lenses and close range targets. We give a comprehensive interpretation of the two minima and derive an analytical solution that locates the second minimum. Based on this solution, we develop a new algorithm for unique and robust pose estimation from a planar target. In the experimental evaluation, this algorithm outperforms four state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithms.},

abstract = {Existing linear methods for estimating homographies, rely on coordinate normalization, to reduce the error in the estimated homography. Unfortunately, the estimated homography depends on the choice of the normalization. The proposed extension to the (linear) Taubin estimator is the perfect substitute for such methods, as it does not rely on coordinate normalization, and produces homographies whose error is consistent with existing methods. Also, unlike existing linear methods, the proposed Taubin estimator is theoretically unbiased, and unaffected by similarity transformations of the correspondences in the two views. In addition, it can be adapted to estimate other quantities such as trifocal tensors.},
